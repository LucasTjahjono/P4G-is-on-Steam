            <h2>The Long-Awaited Persona Port is Finally on Steam!</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="introduction">
            Persona 4 Golden has finally gotten a port from the small PS Vita to a PC.
            The Persona Series is a very long game and it takes a lot of time to complete. Unless you're kid with no job and it's summer break.
            Either way, Persona is a very good game series and I reccomend it to a lot of people.

                <p>Now that Persona 4 Golden is out of the Vita and into the PC it now has better graphics!
                    the game looks better and is more defined.
                    Making it better than the Vita version, but you can still get a PS Vita and play if you want to feel classic, it's up to you.

                <p>Social Links, or Confidants, as they say it in the new Persona 5/Persona 5 Royal are a important mechanic in the series.
                In Persona 4 Golden social links were meaningless, but your teammates social links can awaken their personas to their
                2nd and 3rd evolution when you max theirs out. If you wanted to make Izanagi-no-okami, one of the best personas, you only need to do Naoto's social link.

            <div class="The Story">
            <img src="images/P4Gstory.jpg" alt="P4Gstorypicture">
            <p>The story of Persona 4 Golden is this, a series of murders happen across Inaba, the town you're staying in for a year.
                You then suddenly get to go into the TV, you use this power to save kidnapped people from dying before Inaba becomes foggy, because
                when that happens, the shadows, the enemies, go berserk. Along the way the people who were kidnapped awaken their Personas and then help out your team.
